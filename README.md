Learning GitHub

I am trying the github processes from via a local repository and pushing up onto the github site.

I have already created and deleted this repostory more then once today. as they say, practice makes perfect.

Also might put up different hello worlds for different languages for more practice of github.

### Also need to learn about markdown

I have added a powershell script that says hello

```html
<body>
 testing code for html
</body>
```

```php
<?php
  $var = 0;
?>
```
